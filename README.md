1. Project Title:-
  
AI Voice Assistant (Speech Recognition & Response)

****************

2. Description:-

This is a simple **AI-powered speech recognition and text-to-speech system**.  
It listens to your voice commands, processes them, and responds with a voice output.  
Currently, it supports a few predefined commands, but it can be extended for more functionality.  

****************

3. Features:-

🔹Recognizes speech using **Google Speech Recognition**  
🔹Responds using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
🔹Supports basic voice commands:

   ✔️ "Hello" → Responds with a greeting  
   ✔️ "How are you?" → Replies with a predefined response  
   ✔️ "What time is it?" → Tells the current time  
   ✔️ "Bye" → Says goodbye  
🔹Repeats the input for unknown commands and informs the user that the model is under development.  

****************

4. Installation:-

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.  
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the following:
    pip install speechrecognition
    pip install pyttsx3 
    pip install pyaudio

****************

5. Usage:-

Run the script to start listening using the following command:
python Speech_to_text_to_speech.py

Once the program is running:

🔹Speak into the microphone.

🔹The system will recognize and respond accordingly.

****************

6. How It Works:-
   
🔹Uses SpeechRecognition to capture voice input.

🔹Converts the spoken words into text using Google Speech Recognition API.

🔹Checks the recognized text against predefined responses.

🔹If it matches known commands, it provides a relevant response.

🔹If it's unknown, it informs the user and repeats the input.

🔹Converts the response into speech using pyttsx3.

🔹Outputs the response as an audio reply.

****************

7. Future Improvements:-

🔹 Support for more conversational topics.

🔹 Integration with AI-based chatbots (e.g., OpenAI, ChatterBot).

🔹 Multi-language support.

🔹 Voice activation ("Hey Assistant" to wake up).
